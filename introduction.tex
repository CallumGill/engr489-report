\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
This project aims to develop a product that solves the problem of presenting essential information to employees in a concise, easy to read and measurable way. This project was suggested as further development of a proof of concept that HAUNT, a small web development company suggested. HAUNT acted as an industry supervisor for this project development as well as product owner. The product aims to be a micro learning management system that reduces a lot of the overhead of HR around keeping employees informed about procedures and policies within a company. This report will cover the motivations behind this product, the development and implimentation of the product, engineering choices involved and the evaluation of the product with expert feedback.

\section{Haunt}
HAUNT is a start up company that develops and maintains various websites. As they are a new company they have recently gone through the human resource management of hiring new employees and informing them of company policies, health and safety and information on the company and relevant technology. They identified the potential need for a system to easily convey and manage this information quickly and efficiently.

\section{Problem and Motivation}
The problem identified by HAUNT was the lack of a lightweight system that could be easily updated, inform users of their relevant information and present the required information in a non intrusive and intuitive manner that portrayed the important information without being overbearing.

This problem can be split up into two main issues, the display and organization of the information and the notifications to the user along with displaying user relevant information.

\section{Available Solutions}
There are two potential types of product that partially solve the issues identified. These are learning management tools (LMS) and wikis. However these solutions are only partial solutions to the problem and are aimed at solving different but similar issues.
